        - title: Welcome
          content: Research in the Anderies Lab focuses on the interplay between
            institutions, decision-making and the environment in an effort to
            inform robust institutional design for coupled
            social-ecological-technical systems. Other areas of interest include
            economic growth, demographics, migration, resilience and robustness
            of coupled infrastructure systems.

        - title: Our Research Network
          content: Our lab is housed in the Center for Behavior, Institutions, and the
            Environment (CBIE) and benefits from an international network
            focused on the capacity of societies to navigate change, from the
            level of individual decisions, to emergent structures that impact
            resilience and robustness, to global processes. Our research network
            includes collaborators at the Beijer Institute for Ecological
            Economics, The Stockholm Resilience Center, and the Potsdam
            Institute for Climate Impact Research.

        - title: Resources
          content: 'Through our research and teaching activities, we have developed a
            number of open source resources for collaborative research and
            teaching focused on institutional analysis. These include The
            Library on Governance in Social Ecological Systems (<a
            href="https://seslibrary.asu.edu" target="_blank" class="text-white
            text-decoration-underline">the SES Library</a>) and two textbooks:
            <a href="https://sustainingthecommons.org/" target="_blank"
            class="text-white text-decoration-underline">Sustaining the
            Commons</a> and <a href="https://pressbooks.pub/cisi/"
            target="_blank" class="text-white
            text-decoration-underline">Infrastructure for Sustainability</a>. We
            hope you find these resources useful!'

        - title: Research Projects
          content: Our research projects span a number of biophysical contexts across
            renewable resource, water, energy, and transportation systems and
            geographical locations from the US southwest to South Asia, to the
            Arctic. Across this range of coupled infrastructure systems, our
            work focuses on the common theme of understanding how
            institutions (rules and norms) and governance processes impact the
            capacity of these systems to cope with change.
