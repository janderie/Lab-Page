Hoon’s research investigates how coupled natural and human systems
behave under sustainability stresses, and what makes them resilient
and equitable across different governance settings. To address this
question, he studies how human behavior, institutions, and
infrastructure interact over time to shape social-ecological outcomes
and tradeoffs in environmental, climate, and energy policy. His
research agenda focuses on collective action, institutional design,
and system performance under uncertainty and resource constraints.
Methodologically, he combines behavioral experiments, mathematical
and computational modeling, comparative case studies, and rule-based
institutional analysis.
