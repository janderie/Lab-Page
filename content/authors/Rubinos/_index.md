Cathy's research centers on understanding how ecological, social, and 
institutional factors influence the resilience of social-ecological 
systems. Recently, she has developed a keen interest in social and 
environmental innovation, women's entrepreneurship, and informality. Her
 research employs a multi-method approach, incorporating qualitative 
insights from both contemporary and historical case studies, formal 
mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and Qualitative Comparative
 Analysis (QCA).
