Haley distills complex natural resource policy and water 
management issues—via blogs, webinars, infographics, and more—to 
demonstrate why policy is important and how it impacts rivers, lakes, 
groundwater supplies, and wildlife habitat. Alongside a powerful network
 of Audubon advocates, Haley seeks to improve the water outlook in 
Arizona and in the Colorado River Basin—for people and birds.
