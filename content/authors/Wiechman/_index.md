Adam's research examines the governance processes responsible for investment in sustainable infrastructure transitions. He uses an interdisciplinary approach that combines computational modeling with empirical investigation and builds upon public policy, public administration, political economy, human-natural systems, and sustainability. His recent work has involved urban water systems in Arizona responding to long-term declines in water availability to understand how institutional design contributes to system resilience, distributional equity, and collaboration.
