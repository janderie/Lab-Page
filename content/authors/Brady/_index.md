Ute uses collective action, public policy, and political science methods and a linguistic approach
called the Institutional Grammar to study how the design of institutions (e.g., rules, regulations, policies) can better influence decision-making, policy implementation, and outcomes. My current projects address complex, cross-jurisdictional, social-ecological governance challenges, including international biodiversity conservation, digital knowledge commons, and regional/local sustainability efforts.
